remember to fill up first array from last index. Take 3 pointers last index of first array which is m, last index of second array which is n, and one index to last index of first array which to filled that is m+n.fill the values from end to start and if let say all elements of first array get finished then fill all the remaining elements of first array with remaining value of second array because rest of the first array is sorted
